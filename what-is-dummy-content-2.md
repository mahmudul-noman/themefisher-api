Dummy content, also known as placeholder content, is temporary text, images, or other media used to demonstrate the visual or structural aspects of a website, document, or application. It allows designers and developers to see how the final product will look and function once the actual content is added.

Importance of Dummy Content
Design Visualization: Dummy content helps designers visualize the final layout, ensuring that the design is cohesive and appealing before the actual content is ready.
Client Presentation: It provides clients with a tangible representation of the final product, making it easier to communicate design ideas and get feedback.
Development and Testing: Developers use dummy content to test functionality, layout responsiveness, and user experience without waiting for the final content.
