State-owned National Tea Company (NTC) has spent Tk29 crore from its rights issue proceeds in violation of directives issued by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC).

At the same time, despite owing nearly 17 weeks' wages to tea garden workers and about six months' salaries to officers and employees, the company's board of directors has doubled its meeting fees and granted the chairman a permanent high honorarium.
