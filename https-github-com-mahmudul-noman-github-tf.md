Uruguay, Colombia and Paraguay secured places at the 2026 World Cup in the next-to-last round of South American qualifiers.

The Uruguayans and Colombians had 3-0 wins Thursday, and the Paraguayans had a scoreless draw to advance to the global tournament along with already qualified Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador.

"It's a good way to qualify. The team's offensive play was strong, there were also many highlights in individual performances," Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said.
