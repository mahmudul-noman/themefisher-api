Major Indian fashion retailers are grappling with supply shortages nearly three months after New Delhi restricted the import of readymade garments from Bangladesh through land routes.

Brands such as Marks & Spencer, H&M, Zudio, and Lifestyle are facing delays in replenishing merchandise, with the impact most visible in the affordable fashion segment, according to a report by Indian news portal Business Standard.
